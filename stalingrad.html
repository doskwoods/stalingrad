  <p> The Battle of Stalingrad was the largest battle in the Soviet-Nazi War and arguably of WW2. With lots on the line, if Germany pulls through, they will cut off all of South Eastern Russia and the Caucasus . This may prompt a surrender from Russia, but if Germany can't handle the weather, the Soviet Union may be able to make a comeback with the Winter starting, along with perfect conditions for Russians to fight.</p>

<h2>        Germany and Fascism </h2>

<p> Fascism is a form of government where a Fuhrer has all the power: he can virtually do anything he wants. In Adolf Hitler's reign, the first Fuhrer, he was ruthless, killing millions for their race or religion. Despite these terrible war crimes, Hitler was incredibly popular with the German People. He fixed the economy and raised an army, however, this came at the cost of breaking peace treaties and millions suffering, which many weren't aware of or approved. </p>

                 <p>Hitler wouldn't be opposed by other countries up until World War II, most feared him partly because of his army, but mostly because of his hot head, capable of starting another World War, which nobody wanted.</p> <div>
                 <h2> Enough is enough </h2>
<p>World War II was ignited after Germany demanded that Poland give up Danzig, an important Polish territory, which Poland refused. Consequently, the September campaign began, a humanitarian tragedy,  particularly against Polish Jews who were sent to German Concentration Camps, tortured before being brutally killed.  Despite the blatant war crimes being committed, the USSR, a communist superpower supported Germany. The Moltov-Robentrop Pact was signed between the 2 superpowers in August of 1938. By signing the pact, the USSR and Germany promised they wouldn't attack each other, and divide Poland between themselves. This alliance may've been crucial to a German victory, and possibly world dominance, with another superpower on their side.</p>

<h2> The War Esculates </h2>
<p> The France and UK, disgusted by Germany's invasion, decided to declare war on Germany shortly after the invasion

abandoning their neutrality and protesting to prevent another world war. Throughout the beginning of the war, things looked lopsided from a viewer's perspective. Poland capitulated in months with little resistance, and France, unprepared for an invasion from Normandy, quickly surrendered after Paris and many other major cities were captured. These major successes were largely thanks to a new military tactic Hitler had created, which he called "Blitzkrieg". Blitzkrieg brought quick victories by storming hundreds of thousands of men into areas, completely unprepared for such an invasion. While many German troops were killed, Hitler determined the extra lives lost were worth it to convince the rest of his enemies to surrender.</p>
<h2> Adolf Hitler </h2>
<p>  In 1942, British intelligence began an investigation into Hitler's mental state. The analysis described Hitler as having morbid tendencies, extreme Paranoia, and even epilepsy, likely the reason for him committing such atrocities. Furthermore, when the war had begun to turn against him, the quick downfall of his mental health was certainly disturbing. Phycological experts described him as â€œa man who is seriously contemplating the possibility of utter defeat.", long before the war was even close to over. Hitler needed mental help all his life, none exisited.</p>

<h2> The Eastern Front</h2>
<p>Germany invaded the USSR in June 1941, breaking their "alliance". Many believe this decision was Hitler's worst of the entire war. He ended up deciding "living space", and eradicating the Jews living in Russia, was too important, however, he would now be fighting two wars at the same time. A better reason for Germany's invasion would probably be Hitler's extreme Paranoia.

Despite the disadvantages, The Eastern Front, which was Germany's war with the USSR, for the first few months, seemed like a sure win for Germany. Most modern-day Ukrainian, Belarusian, and Lithuanian territories had capitulated, and just a short while later, Germany was in Russia. By this time, Hitler expected the Soviet Union to surrender, which would leave him unchallenged by everyone but the Allies,  mainly the U.S. and U.K. However, there was a key flaw in his plan, he forgot about the weather. While planning his invasion, Hitler made a quick assumption Russia would surrender before the winter started, thus he did not send his soldiers with coats to protect them from the cold. On the other hand, Stalin gave his soldiers trench coats, made of wool and rubberized. Despite weather, at first glance, being a trivial factor in a situation with millions of civilians and soldiers being brutally killed, Russian soldiers were used to the winter and could go outside for several days or weeks without getting serious diseases, like hypothermia and frostbite, unlike Germans forced indoors. On top of this, German snipers were rendered useless, as their green coats were easily spotted in areas blanketed in snow, while Russian snipers were even harder to find as they camouflaged with their surroundings.</p>

<h2> The Battle Begins </h2>
<p> As expected, Hitler invaded Stalingrad on August 23, 1943. Due to scouts discovering the army days before the battle, the Soviet Union had already evacuated 400,000 Soviet citizens living there. Their troops were also prepared, entrenched, and ready to make a stand from their forts. The battle began from the air when around 1000 tons worth of bombs were dropped. The bombing was successful for Germany, as at least 90 percent of all housing stock was annihilated by the explosions. The exact number of casualties is still unknown, but, most likely in the tens or low hundreds of thousands. By February of 1943, only 10 to 60 thousand breathing citizens remained in Stalingrad. Before the war, over 400 thousand people lived there. </p>

<p> A relativity unknown general, George Zhukov began a soviet counter offensive in the Battle of Stalingrad. Zhukov started by recuriting fresh forces from all sides of the city. He began the attack in November, and it ended in a complete success, as Von Paulus's Nazi army was surrounded by the Soviets and killed. The remaining Nazis still in Stalingrad were forced to surrender, as they were too outnumbered. About 500,000 Nazi soldiers were killed, and 60,000 were taken prisoner. This rising amount of Casualites was proving very concerning for the axis's chances of winning WWII </p>

            <p> Operation Uranus was the main Soviet Counteroffensive. After a brutal winter and many German defeats, not many Nazis were left in Russia, and they could no longer hold onto the territory they had already conquered. Thus a Russian Counter Offensive was needed before more Nazi soldiers were sent to the Eastern Front. Just months into the campaign, the Soviets had already conquered much of their former land back, and Nazi Germany was shrinking by the second. Germany was being crushed on both sides, as the Americans and British in the west were liberating France and approaching Berlin, the German capital, after a successful D-Day. Soon, the Soviets entered German territory, and consequently, Berlin, the capital of Germany fell in a last stand by Germany. Hearing the news, Hitler and his wife killed themselves when enemy soldiers arrived at his bunker inorder to prevent himself from being humiliated or tortured when he was captured by Soviet soldiers.</p>

<p> Germany surrendered soon after the fall of Berlin, which began peace conferences held in Paris. After a few months of negotiating, the "Big Four" which was the United Kingdom, the U.S. France, and the Soviet Union, decided to split Germany into two countries: East Germany and West Germany. West Germany was democratic and joined NATO, an alliance led by the U.S. shortly after it was founded, while East Germany was communist and aligned with the Soviet Union. Along with this, the treaty also disarmed Germany's army and forced them to pay heavy war reparations.</p>
<h2> Results of The War </h2>
<p>After the war, West Germany ended up having an economic boom, and many damaged cities were rebuilt better then they were before. East Germany, however, was not saved by the Soviet Union. The War reparations were killer to any chance of rebuilding Germany's massive industry, and many of their citizens lived under the poverty line. Despite this, East Germany's unpopular leadership would not be opposed for several years and would fight with the Soviet Union in the Cold War against the U.S up until 1989. On November 9th, the Berlin Wall, a border that prevented West Germans from going to East Germany so they wouldn't see their success, was taken down. Shortly afterwards, East Germany united with West Germany and many flocked to large cities in Western Germany after seeing their prosperous economy. Germany's economy continued to grow after unifying, and today, Germany's economy is the largest in Europe under their democratic regime, even after losing 2 World Wars. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, many communist countries followed East Germany, moving on from their old leaders. The dissolution of the Soviet Union ended up beggining on December 26, 1991.</p>

 <h2> Summary </h2>
 <p>The Battle of Stalingrad was the turning point in the Eastern Front in World War 2 and to many, the entire war. It was the most bloody battle in the entire war with over half a million people dying. After the USSR's victory, the were able to push back Germany to their mainland and eventually capture Berlin and kill Hitler due to their weakened front lines. If it the USSR hadn't won, they would be split in half and would no longer receive resources to fuel their tanks from their southern lands, and would thus be forced to surrender. The Battle of Stalingrad effectively ended Hitler's bold hopes of conquering the world.</p>
